# Castle of Illusions
This project contains a **text-based adventure game** (found in **game.py**) that uses concepts of The **Theory of Computation** and an **engine** for:
* Deterministic Finite Automata (**DFA**)
* Nondeterministic Finite Automata (**NFA**)
* PushDown Automata (**PDA**)
* Context-Free Grammar (**CFG**)

Each IN file (e.g. "pda.in") contains an **example** of how you could use that engine.
